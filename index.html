<!-- INSTALL COMPASS IN MAC IS A LENGHTY PROCEES JUST DOWNLOAD IT FROM COMUNITY SERVER A FOLDER WILL BE DOWNLOAD THE CUT ALL THE FILES INSIDE OF IT AND 
GOT THE USER/TABREJ AND CREATE A FOLDER AS WANT I CREATED IT DEVELOPMENT/MONGODB AND HERE PASTE THE FILES INSIDE THE MONGO DB CRATE ANOTHER FOLDER
data AND INSIDE IT CREATE db the return back to the users/tabrej and find .zprofile if there is no file just create it and 
write 
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/tabrej/development/mongodb/bin"
this is the path file for mongodb/bin where paste all the data we can say that here we set the pathe variables of another languages also -->







   <!--
for create a new database just write use db_name 
 for create new table(collection in mongodb) and insert  a single data just write db.student.insertOne({name:"tabrej",roll:234,age:28}) db represent the current database that u are using

 to show a collectiion of data base show collections
 
 to show the data of any collection in a database db.student.find() or db.student.find().pretty()
db is an alias of current database
******************insert query********************************
we can insert one data as well as many data at one time insertOne({}) is used for onet data and insertMany([{},{},{}.....])

******************find query********************************
we can find a specific data using find(query,projection)

db.student.find() shows all data of collection
db.student.find({name:"tabrej"}).pretty() shows all the data of name tabrej only
if we want to show only name tabrej the we have to print only name and false the other value
db.student.find({name:"tabrej"},{name:1}).pretty()  here in projection name is true but it olso shows the id field by defauult 
if we doesnt want to show the id field then we have to write db.student.find({name:"tabrej"},{_id:0,name:1}).pretty()
if there is more than one field contains same name or  roll or any data and we only want to show the first data the we write db.student.find({name:"tabrej"},{name:1}).pretty().limit(1) this wil filter the data and shows fist data only ther is one more method to do this
db.student.findOne({name:"tabrej",{name:1}})
if we ant to skip the data and shows some specific no of data 
db.student.find({name:"tabrej"},{name:1}).pretty().limit(1).skip(1) this will skip the first data 


******************update query********************************
UpdateOne()=>db.collectionname.updateOne(filter,update)
UpdateMany()=>db.collectionname.update(filter,update)
db.student.updateOne( {name:"tabrej"}, {$set: {name:"sonu"} } )   it will first filter and find by name field and then update the name field to sonu
db.student.updatemany( {name:"tabrej"}, {$set: {name:"sonu"} } ) if there is more than one field with same name it will update all the va;ues


*****************Delete query********************************

deleteMany()=>b.collectionname.deleteMany(criteria)
db.student.deleteMany({roll:203}) it will only delete the data of roll 203

db.student.deleteMany()  it will empty the collection
